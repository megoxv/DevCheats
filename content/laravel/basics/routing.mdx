# Routing in Laravel 11

Laravel provides a powerful routing system for defining web and API routes.

## Basic Routes

Define routes in `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`.

```php
// routes/web.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Welcome to Laravel 11!';
});
