# Routing in Next.js

Next.js uses a **file-based routing system**. Every file in the `pages` directory becomes a route.

## Basic Routing

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`

Example:
```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
