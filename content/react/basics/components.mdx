# React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be **functional** or **class-based**.

## Functional Components

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are simple and easy to write.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
